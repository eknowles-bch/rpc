# Impact of Voltage-Gated Calcium-Channel Genes on Bipolar Illness Risk in Child-Affected Trios

## Mentor Name:

Emma Knowles PhD (emma.knowles@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Bipolar Disorder, Family Study, Genetics, Rare Variation, Biomarker Identification

## Brief Description of the Project: 

The goal of the project is to relate specific aspects of bipolar symptomatology to functional single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and/or copyâ€“number variants (CNVs) in voltage-gated calcium-channel (VGCC) genes/gene networks, thereby providing mechanistic insights into the neurobiology of bipolar. We have almost completed the recruitment of 30 families with an affected child. All individuals have extensive clinical phenotyping as well as cognitive assessments and whole exome sequence and CNV data.
