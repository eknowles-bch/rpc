# Role of Genetic and Environmental Factors in Risk for Early-Onset Psychosis

## Mentor Name:

David Glahn PhD (david.glahn@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Psychosis, Family Study, Genetics, Rare Variation, Biomarker Identification, and Copy Number Variation.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

This project is encompassed by the Early Intervention in Psychosis Center (EPICenter). The EPICenter integrates clinical, translational, and basic research with clinical care for children and adolescents with early (or very early) onset psychosis and their families. To date we have enrolled 200 individuals with psychosis plus their family members and typically developing controls. We aim to related rare genetic variation to illness risk, as well as aspects of psychosis symptomatology. Additionally, we aim to characterize this sample in terms of their cognitive and early-life trauma profiles, as well as additional environmental risk factors. A subset of the sample has completed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, thus enabling the identification of functional and morphological brain markers for early psychosis.
