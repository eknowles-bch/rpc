# Unraveling Depression in Adolescents by Modeling Dynamic Fluctuations in Inflammation and Sleep Biology

## Mentor Name:

Emma Knowles PhD (emma.knowles@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Major Depressive Disorder, Intensive Longitudinal, Inflammation, Activity, Sleep, Biomarker Identification.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

This project is designed to develop immune and sleep biomarkers for major depressive disorder in adolescents. By identifying reliable prognostic biomarkers, we hope to better forecast the development or worsening of depressive symptoms and suicidality in patients, allowing for earlier and more personalized clinical intervention.
