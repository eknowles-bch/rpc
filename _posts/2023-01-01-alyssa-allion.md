# Developing Measures of Neuroplasticity using Neuroimaging to Improve Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes

## Mentor Name:

Alyssa Ailion, PhD (alyssa.ailion@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Neuroimaging, Neurological Disorders, Neuropsychological Assessment, Clinical Outcomes, Machine Learning, Brain Analytics, and Clinical Translation.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

This project is centered on leveraging new imaging and computational approaches to understand and facilitate brain plasticity, aiming to uplift the standard of care in pediatric epilepsy surgery. Our focus areas are: 1) Longitudinal Analysis: Examining post-operative changes in functional brain networks, including aspects like language, motor functions, and memory, to shed light on brain reorganization induced by disease and surgery. 2) Technological Integration: Developing automated imaging pipelines and 3D visualization tools that integrate various technologies such as MRI, fMRI, DTI, sEEG, MEG and PET, to assist in precise brain surgery planning. 3) Predictive Modeling: Utilizing theoretical models of brain plasticity and reorganization to interpret imaging and cognitive data, identifying factors that influence brain adaptability and function. We are actively seeking students and mentees who want to learn about functional MRI.s but you know sometimes problems arise from nowhere.
