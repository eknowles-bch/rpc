# Predicting Long-term Neuropsychological Outcomes Post Epilepsy Surgery

## Mentor Name:

Alyssa Ailion, PhD (alyssa.ailion@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Neuroimaging, Neurological Disorders, Neuropsychological Assessment, Clinical Outcomes, Machine Learning, Brain Analytics, and Clinical Translation.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

This project undertakes a comprehensive study of children with refractory focal epilepsy who are surgical intervention candidates to better predict post-surgical outcomes. We have gathered and organized a rich dataset comprising neuropsychological, psychosocial, and adaptive behavior assessments, along with medical and diagnostic data. Being part of a multi-site collaboration, we have access to a national dataset, which facilitates in-depth analysis and understanding of the surgery outcomes beyond just seizure control. We apply longitudinal models to understand how surgical excision of the seizure foci impacts medical, neurocognitive, and psychosocial outcomes.
