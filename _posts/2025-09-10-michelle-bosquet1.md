Trauma, Stress, Early Childhood Mental Health, Intergenerational Processes, Biomarkers.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

Early life stress (ELS) increases risk for maladaptive socioemotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning and mental and physical health problems through adulthood. The goal of this study is to test associations among repeated measures of early life stress, stress-relevant biomarkers (e.g., telomere length attrition, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system stress functioning, oxidative stress) and prefrontal cortex functioning, which is involved in a range of socioemotional, cognitive, behavioral, and mental health outcomes throughout life. Study participants were recruited in pregnancy and followed to age 5 years. The database includes comprehensive, repeated assessments of stress exposures, biological stress reactivity, and neurobehavioral functioning from pregnancy through age 5 years. The main analytic goals of this project include examining links among maternal stress in pregnancy and relevant biomarkers at birth; child exposure to stress in early childhood and concurrent and later biomarkers; biomarkers from pregnancy though age 5 and child cognitive and mental health outcomes. Strengths of this study include its comprehensive assessment of stress exposures and multiple biomarkers in relation to a number of child cognitive and mental health outcomes. The findings may be translated into strategies to identify and treat at-risk children to prevent a range of maladaptive outcomes across the lifespan.
