# Early Warning Signs of Age-Related Hearing Loss

## Mentor Name:

Samuel Mathias, PhD (samuel.mathias@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Hearing Loss, Presbycusis, Prediction, Genetics, Family History, Psychophysics, and Electrophysiology.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

Presbycusis is later-life hearing loss occurring without exposure to noise or other exogenous factors. Presbycusis is heritable, meaning that a young person is more likely to develop presbycusis later in life if they have a relative with the disorder. This Harvard Catalyst-funded project will recruit currently normal hearing individuals with and without a family history of presbycusis and assess them using a battery of experimental behavioral and electrophysiological auditory measures designed to discover the “early warning signs” of presbycusis. Discovery of these early warning signs could expand future treatment and management options by allowing more accurate prediction of who will develop the disorder years before its primary symptoms emerge.
