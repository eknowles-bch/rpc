## Brief Description of the Project: 

The clinical high-risk (CHR) paradigm is a widely used framework to investigate mechanisms underlying psychosis vulnerability. Help-seeking individuals who do not meet diagnostic criteria for a psychotic disorder but typically present with subthreshold psychotic symptoms and accumulating risk factors are considered at CHR for developing psychosis. An estimated 18% to 20% of individuals at CHR develop a psychotic disorder within 2 years of identification, although conversion rates vary, likely due to heterogeneous recruitment and sampling strategies as well as interventions applied. The ENIGMA Clinical High Risk (CHR) working group investigates cognitive, clinical, and brain alterations in those at clinical high risk for psychosis. Individuals who are in the clinical high-risk state are help-seeking individuals who do not meet diagnostic criteria for a psychotic disorder but typically present with subthreshold psychotic symptoms and accumulating risk factors. We bring together existing datasets that have recruited individuals considered to be at “Clinical High Risk” for psychosis (CHR), according to well-established criteria. Participating sites have also recruited a “healthy control” comparison group (i.e., an individual free from a psychiatric disorder diagnosis per a screen or clinical interview). We are carrying out large-scale meta- and mega-analyses of clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging data to identify alterations in CHR. We are examining the associations between neuroimaging measures, demographic measures, cognitive and clinical data in the CHR and healthy control groups.
