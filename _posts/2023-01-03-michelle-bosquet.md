# Neural, Physiological, Behavioral, and Environmental Risk Markers of Anxiety from Infancy to Adolescence

## Mentor Name:

Michelle Bosquet Enlow, PhD (michelle.bosquet@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Anxiety, Risk Identification, Developmental Psychopathology, and EEG.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

This project is testing the combined effects of neural (EEG/ERP/fNIRS), physiological, behavioral, and environmental risk factors on the development and maintenance/exacerbation of anxiety from infancy through adolescence. Data are from an established longitudinal cohort who have provided an extensive dataset to date between infancy and age 7 years and are currently being followed for assessments at ages 11 and 13 years. We are applying a combination of established and novel analysis approaches to develop diagnostic neural biomarkers of anxiety; identify positive and negative environmental characteristics that influence anxiety-relevant neural signatures, that affect anxiety-related neural trajectories across development, and that moderate the effects of neural reactivity on anxiety risk; determine how COVID-19 related stressors interact with childhood pre-pandemic characteristics to influence anxiety risk; and to develop assay profiles comprising neural, physiological, behavioral, and/or environmental characteristics that robustly predict anxiety trajectories across development. We hope that this information will (a) improve our understanding of the neural circuitry underlying anxiety risk in youth, (b) contribute to the discovery of robust developmentally-informed multi-modal profiles that can identify at-risk children, and (c) inform the design of innovative strategies to prevent the emergence of anxiety and to treat more precisely symptomatic youth by addressing and correcting atypical neural processes and their downstream behavioral manifestations.
