# Large-Scale Evaluation of the Effect of Rare Genetic Variants on Psychiatric Symptoms and Cognitive Ability

## Mentor Name:

David Glahn PhD (david.glahn@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Copy number variation, Genetics; Rare Variation, Biomarker Identification, Affective Disorders, and Cognition.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

Rare copy number variants (CNVs) are strongly associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that they might serve as a magnifying glass to study general mechanisms of psychopathology as otherwise subtle perturbations to neuropsychiatric functions may be more clearly discerned through the major `hit' of the CNV. However, our understanding of the impact of CNVs on psychiatric symptomatology, RDoC domains and neurocognitive ability (termed `dimensional neuropsychiatric phenotypes') is limited in at least three ways. First, the effects sizes of the vast majority of CNVs on neuropsychiatric phenotypes remain poorly understood and their rarity will likely to prevent individual association studies. We will fill these knowledge gaps with a novel, multidisciplinary, collaborative project that leverages existing archival data (n=1,000,000) to estimate and predict the effect sizes of CNVs (duplications and deletions) on dimensional neuropsychiatric phenotypes.
