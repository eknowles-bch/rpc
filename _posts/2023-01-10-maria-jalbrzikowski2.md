# Leveraging Electronic Health Records to Improve Risk Prediction for Psychosis and Bipolar Disorder

## Mentor Name:

Maria Jalbrzikowski, PhD (maria.jalbrzikowski@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Self-Harm, Bipolar Disorder, Psychosis, Electronic Health Records, Early Intervention and Detection of Severe Psychiatric Disorders.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

This project proposes to use electronic health records to find objective markers of risk for psychotic and bipolar disorder in U.S. youth. We will use data-driven approaches to identify meaningful, temporally linked associations between multiple measures of risk and subsequent psychotic or bipolar disorder diagnoses. We will first validate that hospital presentation with intentional self-harm is associated increased risk for a subsequent diagnosis of psychotic or bipolar disorder.  We will then test how an array of other objective predictors (e.g., medical or psychiatric comorbidities, childhood trauma, neuroimaging scores from clinical MRIs) confer elevated risk for severe psychopathology onset. Results from this study will allow us to use electronic health records to identify cost-effective indicators of severe psychopathology, ultimately improving identification of young people at greatest risk and allowing earlier more effective interventions.
