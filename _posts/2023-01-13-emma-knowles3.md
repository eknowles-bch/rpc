# Inflammation Variation and Reward Responsiveness in Depressed Youth 

## Mentor Name:

Emma Knowles PhD (emma.knowles@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Major Depressive Disorder, Family Study, Genetics, Rare Variation, Inflammation, Biomarker Identification

## Brief Description of the Project: 

The goal of the project is to delineate the relationship between variation in well-established inflammation genes and gene networks and MDD, anhedonia and reward responsivity (indexed via reinforcement learning and a behavioral monetary incentive delay task). Specific aims are to: (1) characterize the relationship between reward responsivity and anhedonia; (2) test association between genetic variation in inflammation pathways, peripheral immune levels, and reward/anhedonia; and (3) explore genotype-environment interactions between de novo inflammation variants and trauma. Delineating the ways in which these complex systems interact will yield novel mechanistic insights into adolescent MDD and by extension highlight key risk, diagnostic and treatment targets.
