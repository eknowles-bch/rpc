# Building a public health model for the prevention of violent extremism

## Mentor Name:

Heidi Ellis PhD (heidi.ellis@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Violent Radicalization, Trauma, Social Belonging, and Public Health.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

This project uses broad survey data (n=~1,000) to understand risk and protective factors for individuals endorsing support for violence to promote far-left, far-right or other issues or causes. Taking a public health model we will seek to identify psychosocial, modifiable risk and protective factors. This data will then be used to identify existing public health approaches that can be drawn on to specifically target these risk and protective factors, and to work with three communities to identify how these approaches could be implemented in their communities.
