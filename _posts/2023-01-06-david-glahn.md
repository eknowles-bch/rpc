# Genetic Architecture of Early-Onset Psychosis in Mexicans (EPIMex)

## Mentor Name:

David Glahn PhD (david.glahn@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Psychosis, Family Study, Genetics, Rare Variation, Biomarker Identification, and Copy Number Variation.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

To date we have enrolled 1000 early onset psychosis (EOP) probands plus demographically matched, typically developing demographic controls (TDC; i.e., non-psychotic youth). In this study we aim to: 1) characterize EOP probands and siblings in terms of cognitive and psychosocial functioning and frequency of early life adversity (ELA) to demonstrate that our underserved population is comparable to prior cohorts; 2) document the prevalence of 25 rare but recurrent CNVs previously associated with schizophrenia or autism spectrum disorder in EOP participants relative to their biological family members and demographic and population controls; and 3) examine the prevalence of gene-disruptive and putatively protein-damaging rare variants in affected participants relative to family members and controls.
