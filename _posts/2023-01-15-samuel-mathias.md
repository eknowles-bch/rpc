# Exploring the Link Between Hearing Loss and Dementia

## Mentor Name:

Samuel Mathias, PhD (samuel.mathias@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Hearing Loss, Alzheimer's, Dementia, Cognitive Decline, Genomics, Genetics, Epidemiology, and Big Data

## Brief Description of the Project: 

People with a diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss are at roughly double the normal risk for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. There are two potential explanations for this relationship. The first (the causal hypothesis) is that hearing loss causes dementia, for example by causing cortical circuits to atrophy due to sensory deprivation. The second (the common-pathway hypothesis) is that one or more genetic and/or environmental factors jointly increase risk for hearing loss and dementia. To test these competing hypotheses, we will apply Mendelian randomization and multivariate genome-wide association to the genomic data and medical records from NIH's All of Us program. The aims are test for the presence or absence a direct causal relationship between hearing loss and dementia; and (2) identify specific genetic and/or environmental variables that jointly influence hearing loss and dementia risk.
