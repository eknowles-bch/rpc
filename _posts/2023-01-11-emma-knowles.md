# Examining Longitudinal Relationships Between Fluctuations in Mood, Sleep and Physical Activity in Adolescent MDD

## Mentor Name:

Emma Knowles PhD (emma.knowles@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Affective Disorders, Biomarker Identification

## Brief Description of the Project: 

This project uses intensive digital phenotyping (EMA and biometrics) to index mood, anhedonia, anxiety, life stress, plus sleep and activity in adolescents with an MDD diagnosis and matched control subjects. We will apply cross-sectional and lagged mixed models to identify immediate and precedent/antecedent risk factors for low mood. This makes up part of a larger project with a focus on inflammation, genetic variation, neuroimaging, and reward learning.
