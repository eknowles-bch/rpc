# Predicting psychosis risk in youth using a novel structural neuroimaging score and bringing it to communities using portable, low-field MRI

## Mentor Name:

Maria Jalbrzikowski, PhD (maria.jalbrzikowski@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Early intervention and detection of severe psychiatric disorders.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

Converging lines of evidence support the hypothesis that deviations from typical brain structure development take place prior to psychosis onset, while ‘big data’ neuroimaging studies of adults with psychosis find subtle, widespread gray matter disruptions in the brain. We are synergizing knowledge about normative brain development and findings from adults with schizophrenia to develop cost-effective brain-based markers of psychosis risk in youth. To improve identification of those at greatest risk, we leverage results from large-scale structural neuroimaging studies of psychosis to create a ‘Psychosis NeuroScore’, a cumulative summary score that reflects one’s psychosis liability. We are also testing our ability calculate this score using low-field MRI scans in community sample of youth.  This project could easily be extended to include the study of other disorders, including depression and substance abuse.
