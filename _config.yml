  The Research Project Catalogue (RPC) comprises a list of mentors and a description of their current research projects. The purpose of this catalogue is to streamline and enhance the process of connecting mentors and mentees for potential research projects within the Department of Psychiatry. We encourage trainees in the department to peruse the RPC and reach out to mentors with whom they have shared interests. First and foremost we foresee this being used for formal fellowship and training grant applications (e.g., HMS Fellowship awards or  development of K-awards). However, even if you are not in the process of putting together a formal application and instead you are simply interested in research. Please feel free to reach out to any of the listed investigators so that you can discuss getting involved in ongoing projects.
